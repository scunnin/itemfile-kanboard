Project Permissions
===================

Each project is isolated and compartmented from each other.
The project access must be allowed by the project owner.

Each user and each group can have a different role assigned.
There are 3 types of [roles for projects](roles.markdown):

- Project Manager
- Project Member
- Project Viewer

Only administrators have access to everything.

Roles assignation is available from **Project Settings > Permissions**:

If you choose to allow everybody, all Kanboard users will be considered Project Member.
That also means there is no role management anymore. Permission per user or per group cannot be applied.

Private projects cannot define permission.
