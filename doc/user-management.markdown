When you create a **local user**, you have to specify at least those values:

- **username**: This is the unique identifier of your user (login)
- **password**: The password of your user must have at least 6 characters

For **remote users**, only the username is mandatory. You can also pre-link Github or Google accounts if you already know their unique id.

Edit users
----------

When you go to the **users** menu, you have the list of users, to modify a user click on the **edit link**.

- If you are a regular user, you can change only your own profile
- You have to be an administrator to be able to edit any users

Remove users
------------

From the **users** menu, click on the link **remove**. This link is visible only if you are administrators.

If you remove a specific user, **tasks assigned to this person will be unassigned** after the operation.
